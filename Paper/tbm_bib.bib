  abstract = {One major challenge in using statistical sequence learning methods
	in the domain of music lies in bridging the long timelags that separate
	important musical events. Consider, for example, the chord changes
	that convey the basic structure of a pop song. A sequence learner
	that cannot predict chord changes will almost certainly not be able
	to generate new examples in a musical style or to categorize songs
	by style. Yet, it is surprisingly difficult for a sequence learner
	to bridge the long timelags necessary to identify when a chord change
	will occur and what its new value will be. This is the case because
	chord changes can be separated by dozens or hundreds of intervening
	notes. One could solve this problem by treating chords as being special
	(as did Mozer, NIPS 1991). But this is impractical---it requires
	chords to be labeled specially in the dataset, limiting the applicability
	of the model to non-labeled examples---and furthermore does not address
	the general issue of nested temporal structure in music. I will briefly
	describe this temporal structure (known commonly as "meter") and
	present a model that uses to its advantage an assumption that sequences
	are metrical. The model consists of an autocorrelation-based filtration
	that estimates online the most likely metrical tree (i.e. the frequency
	and phase of beat, measure, phrase &etc.) and uses that to generate
	a series of sequences varying at different rates. These sequences
	correspond to each level in the hierarchy. Multiple learners can
	be used to treat each series separately and their predictions can
	be combined to perform composition and categorization. I will present
	preliminary results that demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.
	Time permitting I will also compare the model to alternate approaches.},

  abstract = { This dissertation uses a network of relaxation oscillators to beat
	along with temporal signals. Relaxation oscillators exhibit interspersed
	slow-fast movement and model a wide array of biological oscillations.
	The model is built up gradually: first a single relaxation oscillator
	is exposed to rhythms and shown to be good at finding downbeats in
	them. Then large networks of oscillators are mutually coupled in
	an exploration of their internal synchronization behavior. It is
	demonstrated that appropriate weights on coupling connections cause
	a network to form multiple pools of oscillators having stable phase
	relationships. This is a promising first step towards networks that
	can recreate a rhythmical pattern from memory. In the full model,
	a coupled network of relaxation oscillators is exposed to rhythmical
	patterns. It is shown that the network finds downbeats in patterns
	while continuing to exhibit good internal stability. A novel non-dynamical
	model of downbeat induction called the Normalized Positive (NP) clock
	model is proposed, analyzed, and used to generate comparison predictions
	for the oscillator model. The oscillator model compares favorably
	to other dynamical approaches to beat induction such as adaptive
	oscillators. However, the relaxation oscillator model takes advantage
	of intrinsic synchronization stability to allow the creation of large
	coupled networks. This research lays the groundwork for a long-term
	research goal, a robotic arm that responds to rhythmical signals
	by tapping along. It also opens the door to future work in connectionist
	learning of long rhythmical patterns.},

	to categorise data using a synchrony-based latching mechnanism. This
	is particularly useful in problems where timewarping is encountered,
	such as speech recognition. Differentiable recurrent neural networks
	(RNNs) by contrast fail at tasks involving difficult timewarping,
	despite having sequence learning capabilities superior to SNNs. In
	this paper we demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an
	RNN capable of robustly categorizing timewarped speech data, thus
	combining the most useful features of both paradigms. We compare
	its performance to SNNs on two variants of a spoken digit identification
	task, using data from an international competition. The first task
	(described in Nature (Nadis 2003)) required the categorisation of
	spoken digits with only a single training exemplar, and was specifically
	designed to test robustness to timewarping. Here LSTM performed better
	than all the SNNs in the competition. The second task was to predict
	spoken digits using a larger training set. Here LSTM greatly outperformed
	an SNN-like model found in the literature. These results suggest
	that LSTM has a place in domains that require the learning of large
	timewarped datasets, such as automatic speech recognition.},

	sequence 3)Phrasing makes a difference. Therefore phrasing is not
	just ornamental, but rather structural. Ties meter to setence grammar.
	Gives context free set of production rules for a given meter. Eg.
	4/4 --> whole note or whole rest or (2/4 + 2/4) 2/4 --> half note
	or half rest or (1/4 + 1/4) 6/8 --> dotted half note or dotted half
	rest or (3/8 + 3/8) 3/8 --> dotted quarter note or dotted quarter
	rest or (1/8 +1/8 + 1/8) 3/4 --> dotted half note or dotted half
	rest or (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) 1/4 --> quarter note or quarter rest or
	(1/8 + 1/8) Some nice structural observations. A simple meter can
	be recognized as a list of divisions between levels in M.H. For example,
	4/4 is divided by 2 all the way down: [2,2,2,2,2] 3/4 is [3,2] 6/8
	is [2,3] Tree structure. Root is bar.Terminal nodes are either sounded
	notes or rests Relationship between rhythm and meter: Rhythm is one
	of the structures generated by a grammar associated between a particular
	meter. Syncopation defined formally by doing the following. First,
	replace all rests where possible with ties Weight notes by noticing
	how high in metrical hierachy they live. If a note is tied back to
	one having equal or lesser weight, it is syncopated. That is, if
	rests have higher weights than preceding notes, there is syncopation.
	A "puzzle": how can listeners find syncopation hearing only relative
	note durations. In the end an interesting paper. Can it be reduced
	to NPOS? Maybe. . . h },

	traditional RNNs when dealing with sequences involving not only short-term
	but also long-term dependencies. The decoupled extended Kalman filter
	learning algorithm (DEKF) works well in online environments and reduces
	significantly the number of training steps when compared to the standard
	gradient-descent algorithms. Previous work on LSTM, however, has
	always used a form of gradient descent and has not focused on true
	online situations. Here we combine LSTM with DEKF and show that this
	new hybrid improves upon the original learning algorithm when applied
	to online processing.},

	erroneously taken to imply that perceptual factors (as suggested

	is the critical difference between this task and e.g. the finger

	Essens and Povel:95 in being biased towards 2:1, but I'm not sure....
	Interestingly, a target ratio of 0.5 (i.e. 2:1) was reproduced as
	0.4x, showing the known tendency to keep groups distinct (my reading)
